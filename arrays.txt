Static Array:
is a fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range [0, n - 1]
Indexable -> each slot/index in the array can be referenced with a number

When and where is a static array used?
Storing and accessing sequential data
Temporarily storing objects
Used by IO routines as buffers
Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
Can be used to return multiple values from a function
Used in dynamic programing to cache answers to subproblems

Complexity:
      Static Array  Dynamic Array
Acces       O(1)            O(1)
Search      O(n)            O(n)
Insertion   N/A             O(n)
Appending   N/A             O(1)
Deletion    N/A             O(n)

Dynamic arrays
Array that can grow and shrink in size
How can we implement a dynamic array?
One way is to use a static array
Create a static array with an initial capacity
Add elements to the underlying static array, keeping track of the number of elements
If adding another element will exceed the capacity, then create a new static array with twice the capacity and copy the original element into it
